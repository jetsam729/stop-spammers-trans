msgid "Stop Spammers — Protection Options"
msgstr ""

msgid "Protection Options"
msgstr ""

msgid "Only Use the Plugin for Standard WordPress Forms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Stop Spammers normally kicks off whenever someone fills out a form and "
"presses submit.<br />This means it checks all the forms on a website, not "
"just comments and logins.<br />This option will limit the plugin to wp-"
"comments-post.php and wp-login.php.<br />WooCommerce and other plugins will "
"not be checked.<br />Use this option if you are running an ecommerce site or "
"a specialized site that has forms that are blocked by Stop Spammers.<br /"
">For the most protection, this option is off by default (recommended)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prevent Lockouts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This plugin aggressively checks for spammers and is unforgiving to the "
"point<br />where even you may get locked out of your own website when you "
"log off and try to log back in.<br />There are two options which help "
"prevent this, but these options can make it easier for a spammer to hack "
"your site.<br />When you are confident that the plugin is working you can "
"uncheck these boxes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatically Add Admins to Allow List"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever an administrative user logs in, the IP address is added to the "
"Allow List.<br />This means that you can't be locked out unless your IP "
"address changes or you log in from a different location.<br />As soon as a "
"login is successful then the IP is white-listed to prevent future problems."
"<br />Disable this if you think that you will never be locked out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check Credentials on All Login Attempts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally the plugin checks for spammers before WordPress can try to log in a "
"user.<br />If you check this box, every attempt to log in will be tested for "
"a valid user.<br />This may allow a hacker to guess your user ID and "
"password by making thousands of attempts to login.<br />This is turned on "
"initially to prevent you from being locked out of your own blog,<br />but "
"should be unchecked after you verify that the plugin does not think you are "
"a spammer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Validate Requests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spam bots do not always follow rules. They don't provide the proper request "
"headers or are too quick.<br />These items can be quickly checked. These "
"rules are the most economical way of detecting spammers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Block Spam Missing the HTTP_ACCEPT Header"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block Invalid HTTP_REFERER"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blocks users who have a missing or incomplete HTTP_ACCEPT header. All "
"browsers provide this header.<br />If a hit on your site is missing the "
"HTTP_ACCEPT header it is because a poorly written bot is trying access your "
"site."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you submit a form, all browsers provide the web page that submitted the "
"form.<br />If this referring page is missing or does not match your website "
"then the submission is probably from a program accessing your site.<br /"
">Some phone apps try to log in without the correct header. You may want to "
"disable this function<br />if you log into your website from your mobile "
"device. Test it first - the better  written apps provide the referring page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deny Disposable Email Addresses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spammers who want to hide their true identities use disposable email "
"addresses.<br />You can get these from a number of sites. The spammer "
"doesn't have to register. He just picks up any mail anonymously.<br /"
">Legitimate users use their real email address. It is very likely that "
"anyone using a disposable email address is a spammer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for Long Emails, Author Name, or Password"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spammers can't resist using very long names and emails. This rejects these "
"if they are over 64 characters in length."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for Short Emails or Author Name"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spammers sometimes use blank usernames or author names.<br />If you are "
"having trouble with a plugin or theme not using the correct fields with "
"rejects for short usernames, then uncheck this box."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for BBCodes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"BBCodes are codes like [url] that spammers like to place in comments.<br /"
">WordPress does not support BBCodes without a plugin.<br />If you have a "
"BBCode plugin then disable this. This will mark any comment that has BBCodes "
"as spam."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for Quick Responses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<em>(disabled if caching is active)</em> The plugin will drop a cookie with "
"the current time in it.<br />When the user enters a comment or tries to log "
"into the system, the time is checked.<br />If the user responds too fast, he "
"is a spammer. If cookies are not supported, this is disabled.<br />Use the "
"timeout value below to control the speed (stops the most spammers of all the "
"methods listed here)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Response Timeout Value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<br />This is the time used to determine if a spammer has filled out a form "
"too quickly.<br />Humans take more than 10 seconds, at least, to fill out "
"forms. The default is 4 seconds.<br />If a user takes 4 seconds or less to "
"fill out a form they are not human and are denied.<br />Users who use "
"automatic passwords may show up as false positives, so keep this low."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deny 404 Exploit Probing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bots often search your site for exploitable files.<br />If there is a match "
"to a known exploit URL,this will automatically add the IP address to the "
"Deny List."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deny IPs Detected by Akismet"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Akismet does a good job detecting spam. If Akismet catches a spammer, then "
"the IP address should be added to the bad IP cache.<br />Akismet will "
"continue to block comment spam, but if there is a login or registration "
"attempt from the same IP, it will be blocked."
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for Exploits"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This checks for the PHP eval() function and typical SQL injection strings in "
"comments and login attempts.<br />It also checks for JavaScript that may "
"potentially be used for cross domain exploits."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deny Login Attempts Using 'admin' in Username"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a spammer starts hitting the login page with 'admin' anywhere in the "
"login ID<br />and there is no matching user, then it is a spammer trying to "
"figure out your password.<br />Deny List immediately. This only works if you "
"do not have any users with 'admin' in their username.<br />It is dangerous "
"to have a username 'admin'. Sites get thousands of hits from bots trying to "
"guess the admin password.<br />This has the side effect of preventing users "
"from registering a username with the word admin in it.<br />Users cannot "
"register with 'admin2' or 'superadmin' or 'Administrator.'"
msgstr ""

msgid "Check for Many Hits in a Short Time"
msgstr ""

msgid "Deny access when there are"
msgstr ""

msgid "comments or logins in less than"
msgstr ""

msgid "minutes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spammers hit your site over and over again.<br />If you get more than %s hit"
"(s) in %s minute(s), the spammer will be stopped,<br />added to the bad "
"cache, and shown the challenge page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Filter Login Requests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some plugins and themes bypass the standard registration forms.<br />If you "
"check this, Stop Spammers will try to intercept the login in the WordPress "
"user login module.<br />This will cause some overhead, but gives Stop "
"Spammers another shot at detecting spam.<br />This is turned off by default "
"because it could potentially be called at every page load."
